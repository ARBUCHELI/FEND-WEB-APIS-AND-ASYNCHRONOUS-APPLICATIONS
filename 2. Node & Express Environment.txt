2. Node & Express Environment
-----------------------------
	1. Node.js Overview
	-------------------
		- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript server environment that allows you to execute code outside of a browser, in addition to within the browser.

		- Server-side  code produces dynamic webpage content.

		- Persistence: Maintain created data across visits from the webpage.

		- Allows to easily create a server for local web development, without needing and FTP server or a domain, and lets install packages that are dependencies for my project, 
		very easily and from the command line.

		Node.js Overview
		----------------
			. Open source

			. Cross-platform

			. Server-side scripting

			. Persistence

		The first step to using Node.js is to install it on your computer. You can do so by following the link below and installing the Windows or Mac version, depending on what 
		type of operating system you are using.

		If you've installed Node previously and need to update to a newer version, check out this article.

	2. Using Node
	-------------
		One of the most useful features of Node is that it comes pre-installed with a standard package manager called NPM. NPM started as an easier way to download and manage 
		dependencies of Node.js packages, but now it is also used as a tool in front-end JavaScript as well.

		A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module. Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project. There are hundreds of thousands of 
		Node.js packages and NPM gives you easy access to all of them! For the purposes of this course we will make heavy use of the Node package called Express, as well as 
		packages called CORS which allows for communication across the web, and Body-Parser (which is considered in the category of Middleware) which will allow us to parse the 
		data we eventually will be passing through routes on our server. Let’s take a look at how to install and include these last two packages from the command line using NPM:

		Instructions:
		-------------
		In the terminal:
			npm install express
			npm install body-parser

		Node.js The Big Picture
		-----------------------
			. Server-side code
			. Next up: Express

		Here is the code to install packages with NPM from the command line: npm install package-name

		So to install the package called ‘body-parser’: npm install body-parser

		And to install Cors: npm install cors

		And then in a file named Server.js the installed package is included and made available in the code with: const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

		You need to create the file Server.js in Visual Studio Code.

		Node invokes that require() function with a local file path as the function’s only argument.

		Quiz Question
		-------------
		Which of the following are true about Node and NPM. Check all that apply:

		Asw/ 
			. Node allows developers to write server-side code.
			. NPM is a package manager for Node that allows for easy inclusion of dependencies in a project.
			. To include a Node package already installed via the terminal, the require() function is used.

		Node Quiz 2
		-----------
		Suppose there is a Node package called amazing.js. What line of code would you write in the terminal to include that package in your project?

		Aws/ 
			. npm install amazing.js

		More on Node
		------------
			. For more information about Node.js, you can read their website and documentation, or follow @node.js on Twitter.
			. You can learn more about NPM from their website.
