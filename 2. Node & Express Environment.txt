2. Node & Express Environment
-----------------------------
	1. Node.js Overview
	-------------------
		- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript server environment that allows you to execute code outside of a browser, in addition to within the browser.

		- Server-side  code produces dynamic webpage content.

		- Persistence: Maintain created data across visits from the webpage.

		- Allows to easily create a server for local web development, without needing and FTP server or a domain, and lets install packages that are dependencies for my project, 
		very easily and from the command line.

		Node.js Overview
		----------------
			. Open source

			. Cross-platform

			. Server-side scripting

			. Persistence

		The first step to using Node.js is to install it on your computer. You can do so by following the link below and installing the Windows or Mac version, depending on what 
		type of operating system you are using.

		Node.js Download Page

		If you've installed Node previously and need to update to a newer version, check out this article.

	2. Using Node
	-------------
		One of the most useful features of Node is that it comes pre-installed with a standard package manager called NPM. NPM started as an easier way to download and manage 
		dependencies of Node.js packages, but now it is also used as a tool in front-end JavaScript as well.

		A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module. Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project. There are hundreds of thousands of 
		Node.js packages and NPM gives you easy access to all of them! For the purposes of this course we will make heavy use of the Node package called Express, as well as 
		packages called CORS which allows for communication across the web, and Body-Parser (which is considered in the category of Middleware) which will allow us to parse the 
		data we eventually will be passing through routes on our server. Let’s take a look at how to install and include these last two packages from the command line using NPM:

		Instructions:
		-------------
		In the terminal:
			npm install express
			npm install body-parser

		Node.js The Big Picture
		-----------------------
			. Server-side code
			. Next up: Express

		Here is the code to install packages with NPM from the command line: npm install package-name

		So to install the package called ‘body-parser’: npm install body-parser

		And to install Cors: npm install cors

		And then in a file named Server.js the installed package is included and made available in the code with: const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

		You need to create the file Server.js in Visual Studio Code.

		Node invokes that require() function with a local file path as the function’s only argument.

		Quiz Question
		-------------
		Which of the following are true about Node and NPM. Check all that apply:

		Asw/ 
			. Node allows developers to write server-side code.
			. NPM is a package manager for Node that allows for easy inclusion of dependencies in a project.
			. To include a Node package already installed via the terminal, the require() function is used.

		Node Quiz 2
		-----------
		Suppose there is a Node package called amazing.js. What line of code would you write in the terminal to include that package in your project?

		Asw/ 
			. npm install amazing.js

		More on Node
		------------
			. For more information about Node.js, you can read their website and documentation, or follow @node.js on Twitter.
			. You can learn more about NPM from their website.

	3. Exercise: Node and Package Installation
	------------------------------------------
		Lesson 2 Exercises
		------------------
		L2- Set 1
		---------
			In this set of exercises you will be demonstrating your ability to install dependencies for a Node.js project. Good luck!¶
			1) Double check node is installed by checking the node version in the terminal.

				HIDE SOLUTION
				node --version

			2) Install the cors package from the terminal.

				HIDE SOLUTION
				npm install cors

			3) Install the body-parser package from the terminal

				HIDE SOLUTION
				npm install body-parser

==================================================================================================================================================================

	4. Express Overview
	-------------------
		To install express, we use the npm install express command in the terminal. Using Express we set up an instance of our web app like this:

			// Express to run server and routes
			const express = require('express');

			// Start up an instance of app
			const app = express();

		Express is a framework for Node.js that offers powerful tools for web applications.

		Express is loved by the development community and here are some of the most popular uses:
			. Easy access to common web applications settings:
			--------------------------------------------------
				. Port to use for connecting a Local Server.
				. Allow to use HTTP routes and requests with easy handlers.
				. Middleware:
				-------------
					Middleware is one of the hardest part of bringing really any big web project together.  Middleware is like the glue that holds the different
					parts together.

					For example, we are going to need a data-parser, something that takes in the data from the web, and parses it back and forth between the server
					in case they're speaking slightly different languages like String vs JSON.

				. One of the most simple but powerful applications of Express is the .use method. This allows us to instruct our application to use the necessary Middleware
				such as body-parser

		First, we include express in our project, and then we instantiate an instance of the app we are going to build in a file called server.js. Once we have created an instance 
		of our app using Express, we can connect the other packages we have installed on the command line to our app in our code with the .use() method. Express version 4 and 
		above require an extra middle-ware layer to handle a POST request (You will learn about POST requests in later lessons). This middle-ware is called as bodyParser. This 
		used to be an internal part of the Express framework, but now you have to install it separately. Below is an example of how the body-parser and cors packages discussed 
		earlier could be connected to the app instance.

		/ *Dependencies* /
		const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
		/ *Middleware*/
		//Here we are configuring express to use body-parser as middle-ware.
		app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
		app.use(bodyParser.json());
		// Cors for cross origin allowance
		const cors = require('cors');
		app.use(cors());

		Quiz Question
		-------------
		Which of the following is not a feature associated with Express:

		Asw/
			Express is an API for web apps.

		Express Quiz 2
		--------------
		Assume you have installed a package amazing.js from the terminal, and included it in your project using require() under the name amazing. Assuming you have an instance of 
		an express app running with the name app, what line of code would you write to connect the app to the 'amazing.js' package?

		Asw/	
			app.use(amazing());

		So far we have just seen how Express can be used to create an instance of a web app, and to include other Node packages in that web app, but the real fun of Express is 
		unleashed with Routes. Before we can work with routes however, there are a couple other topics we need to cover. Next we'll learn what a server is, and how to create one 
		locally to develop web projects on our own machines.

		More on Express
		---------------
		You can learn more about Node and Express by reading the Express/Node introduction on the MDN web docs page.

		What about cors, urlencoded and json?
		While we won’t cover cors, urlencoded and json in-depth here, if you want to read about more on each, see the following links:

		Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and related Express documentation for CORS
		URL Encoding and related Express documentation for bodyParser’s urlencoded functionality
		JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and related Express documentation for bodyParser’s json functionality


=================================================================================================================================================================

	5. Exercise: Including Packages
	-------------------------------
				

starter.js
----------
/* Empty JS object to act as endpoint for all routes */
projectData = {};

// TODO-Express to run server and routes
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

// TODO-Start up an instance of app
const app = express();

/* Dependencies */
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// TODO-Cors for cross origin allowance
app.use(cors());
/* Initializing the main project folder */
app.use(express.static('website'));

const port = 3000;

	6. Creating a Local Server I
	----------------------------
		* Creating A Local Server With Node & Express
		---------------------------------------------
			- Often the first thing done in a Node & Express environment is to create a local server, that'll allow an app to run locally in the browser.

			Local Server
			------------
				Receive requests --> Process them --> Return a response

			- We can create servers with Node without having to use an FTP server or other hosting solutions.
	
			- We are going to create routes to dynamically pass data between different parts of our apps.

			- This is the code that we would use to actually write the server: 
			 
			.listen()
			---------
			const port = 8000;

			const server = app.listen(port, listening);

			function listening() {
				console.log("server running");
				console.log(`running on localhost: ${port}`);
			}
